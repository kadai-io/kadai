  /**
   * Determines the distribution of tasks to one or more destination workbaskets based on the
   * provided parameters.
   *
   * <p>This method is invoked by KADAI to calculate the assignment of a set of task IDs to specific
   * destination workbaskets using a custom distribution strategy. The method does not directly
   * perform the distribution but returns the intended mapping of tasks to workbaskets.
   *
   * <p><b>Input Parameters:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code taskIds (List<String>)}: A list of task IDs to be analyzed for distribution.
   *   <li>{@code destinationWorkbasketIds (List<String>)}: A list of destination workbasket IDs
   *       where the tasks are intended to be assigned.
   *   <li>{@code additionalInformation (Map<String, Object>)}: Additional context-specific details
   *       that can influence the distribution logic.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Output:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The method returns a {@code Map<String, List<String>>}, where each key represents a
   *       destination workbasket ID, and the corresponding value is a list of task IDs that should
   *       be assigned to that workbasket.
   *   <li>The returned mapping provides the intended distribution but does not execute any changes
   *       in the system.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Contract:</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The {@code taskIds} and {@code destinationWorkbasketIds} must not be null.
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param taskIds a list of task IDs to be analyzed for distribution
   * @param destinationWorkbasketIds a list of destination workbasket IDs where tasks are intended
   *     to be distributed
   * @param additionalInformation a map of additional details for customizing the distribution logic
   * @return a {@code Map<String, List<String>>} containing the destination workbasket IDs as keys
